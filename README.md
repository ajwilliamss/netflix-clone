# Netflix Clone

Netflix clone built using React and the TMDB API.

The application features a home, login, register, and netflix page.

The user can browse shows and movies on the netflix clone and upon clicking an image, they will be shown a trailer.

All the titles are pulled from the API and when the user scrolls, the navigation bar changes colour.

A slider can be used to scroll through the items in each row.

The register form implements form validation.
